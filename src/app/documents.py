"""Pydantic models for Firestore documents.

Each model represents a document type in a Firestore collection.  Models
provide validation on read/write and a consistent schema across the codebase.

Convention:
    - Model names end with ``Document`` (e.g. ``UserDocument``).
    - The Firestore collection name is derived by lower-casing the prefix
      and pluralising (e.g. ``UserDocument`` → ``users``).
    - ``created_at`` / ``updated_at`` are present on every document.
